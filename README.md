# Customer Insights SQL Project

Hi! I'm Sundas â€” currently learning SQL for data analysis, and this is one of my early hands-on projects.

I worked with a simple customer-orders dataset and explored different SQL concepts like:

## ðŸ“Œ What I Practiced:
- Joins (INNER, LEFT, SELF)
- Group By with Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, LAG, LEAD)
- Conditional logic using CASE and COALESCE
- Filtering, sorting, and subqueries

##  Project Goal:
To analyze customer behavior and purchase patterns â€” like which customers spend the most, how frequently they order, and how sales differ across regions.

##  Tools Used:
- PostgreSQL + pgAdmin4
- GitHub for version control

##  What I Learned:
This project helped me understand how SQL is actually used in real-life data analysis tasks. I practiced writing queries from scratch, fixed errors, and explored how to clean and analyze data using SQL only.
